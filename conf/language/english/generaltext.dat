text_customDesc_1	The greedy Giant Octopus lies in the ocean depths, attacking any ships that come nearby. Only very few can survive its deadly attacks.
text_customDesc_2	Those lucky enough to survive the perils of the sea are most welcome here, where their exhausted state makes them perfect targets for raiding.
text_customDesc_3	Your arrival has made Pirate Butcher, the head pirate, furious. He\'s decided to deal with trouble like you himself.
text_customDesc_4	Subduing the pirate leader doesn\'t mean the road ahead is safe. This area is full of roaming bandits looking to slow your progress.
text_customDesc_5	You will become more and more skilled as you face the pirates here, and your troops will grow stronger from constant battle.
text_customDesc_6	After a streak of misfortune, the sight of the castle is most welcome as you recall the pleasant fragrance from Tavern.
text_customDesc_7	The new friend you met in Tavern looks at your weapon in disgust and decides to take you the weapon smith.
text_customDesc_8	Your friend tells you it\'s survival of the fittest here, a land filled with dragons, bandits and pirates. You\'ll need to be careful.
text_customDesc_9	Of course, danger is not without opportunity. This cave is surrounded by trees, and if you can just defeat the forest monsters the reward and experience will be yours.
text_customDesc_10	Earning a reward has awoken the adventurer spirit within you. You decide to explore the legend of the giant dragons.
text_customDesc_11	You set out for the legendary dragon under your friend\'s guidance. Dragon worshippers up ahead are said to protect the dragon from the interference of mortals.
text_customDesc_12	The dragon guardians disagree with you and think that the weak have no rights to the secrets of the dragon. You try to change their mind.
text_customDesc_13	Just as you\'re feeling rather pleased with the acquisition of the dragon skill, you hear cries for help coming from the village ahead.
text_customDesc_14	After happily accepting the villagers\' gifts you set out on a new voyage. You know the road will be dangerous.
text_customDesc_15	The terrible octopus seems to be waiting for something, but the shiny chest in its arms is what really draws your attention.
text_customDesc_16	The fire dragon has made you unstoppable in battle, but the death of your companions still makes you angry.
text_customDesc_17	You need to acquire more dragon skills in order to battle with greater success.
text_customDesc_18	You\'ll have to pass the dragon\'s test if you want to gain its approval. Acquiring a dragon skill is no simple task, after all.
text_customDesc_end	If you want to explore in a world like this, you\'ll need to be strong enough to face the challenges of today and tomorrow.
text_villageVictoryDesc1_1	You successfully saved the village.
text_villageVictoryDesc1_2	The villagers are grateful for what you\'ve done.
text_villageVictoryDesc1_3	They thank you for defeating the demon that plagued them,
text_villageVictoryDesc1_4	and for saving them from the grip of disaster.
text_villageVictoryDesc1_5	The villagers have decided to offer you everything they have.
